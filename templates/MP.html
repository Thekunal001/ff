                <p class="card-text">Mangal Pandey, (born July 19, 1827, Akbarpur, India—died April 8, 1857,
                    Barrackpore), Indian soldier whose attack on British officers on March 29, 1857, was the first major
                    incident of what came to be known as the Indian, or Sepoy, Mutiny (in India the uprising is often
                    called the First War of Independence or other similar names).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pandey was born in a town near Faizabad in what is now eastern Uttar Pradesh state in northern
                    India, although some give his birth place as a small village near Lalitpur (in present-day
                    southwestern Uttar Pradesh). He was from a high-caste Brahman landowning family that professed
                    strong Hindu beliefs. Pandey joined the army of the British East India Company in 1849, some
                    accounts suggesting that he was recruited by a brigade that marched past him. He was made a soldier
                    (sepoy) in the 6th Company of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, which included a large number of
                    Brahmans. Pandey was ambitious and viewed his profession as a sepoy as a stepping-stone to future
                    success.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Pandey’s career ambitions, however, came into conflict with his religious beliefs. While he was
                    posted at the garrison in Barrackpore in the mid-1850s, a new Enfield rifle was introduced into
                    India that required a soldier to bite off the ends of greased cartridges in order to load the
                    weapon. A rumour spread that the lubricant used was either cow or pig lard, which was repugnant to
                    Hindus or Muslims, respectively. The belief arose among the sepoys that the British had deliberately
                    used the lard on the cartridges.

                <p class="card-text">
                    There have been various accounts of the events of March 29, 1857. However, the general agreement is
                    that Pandey attempted to incite his fellow sepoys to rise up against their British officers,
                    attacked two of those officers, attempted to shoot himself after having been restrained, and
                    eventually was overpowered and arrested. Some contemporary reports suggested that he was under the
                    influence of drugs—possibly cannabis or opium—and was not fully aware of his actions. Pandey was
                    soon tried and sentenced to death. His execution (by hanging) was set for April 18, but British
                    authorities, fearing the outbreak of a large-scale revolt if they waited until then, moved the date
                    up to April 8. Resistance to the use of Enfield cartridges later that month in Meerut led to the
                    outbreak of a revolt there in May and the start of the larger insurrection.
                    <br>
                    In India, Pandey has been remembered as a freedom fighter against British rule. A commemorative
                    postage stamp with his image on it was issued by the Indian government in 1984. In addition, a movie
                    and stage play that depicted his life both appeared in 2005.

                <h3>Beginning of Mangal Pandey and His Attacks</h3>
                <p class="card-text">
                    In 1849, Mangal Pandey enlisted in the Bengal Army. He joined the 5th Company of the 34th Bengal
                    Native Infantry as a private soldier (sepoy) in March 1857. Lieutenant Baugh, Adjutant of the 34th
                    Bengal Native Infantry, then stationed at Barrackpore, was told on the afternoon of March 29, 1857,
                    that many men in his regiment were in an agitated state. Furthermore, he was informed that one of
                    them, Mangal Pandey, was pacing in front of the regiment's guardroom near the parade ground, armed
                    with a loaded musket, urging the men to revolt and threatening to shoot the first European he saw.
                    Pandey had confiscated his guns and ran to the quarter-guard building upon discovering that a
                    detachment of British soldiers was disembarking from a steamer near the cantonment, according to
                    testimony provided at a subsequent inquiry. Pandey had been unsettled by discontent among the sepoys
                    and intoxicated by the narcotic bhang.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Baugh quickly armed himself and galloped to the lines on his horse. Pandey took up position behind
                    the station gun in front of the 34th's quarter-guard, aimed at Baugh, and fired. While he missed
                    Baugh, the bullet hit his horse in the flank, killing both the horse and the rider. Baugh easily
                    disentangled himself, snatched one of his pistols, and charged Pandey, firing. He didn't make it.
                    Pandey struck Baugh with a talwar (a heavy Indian sword) before the adjutant could draw his sword,
                    stabbed Baugh on the shoulder and leg, and knocked him to the ground. Shaikh Paltu, another sepoy,
                    intervened and attempted to restrain Pandey as he attempted to reload his musket.
                </p>
                <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                <p class="card-text">After a government inquiry, the 34th B.N.I. The regiment was disbanded "with shame"
                    on 6 May as a collective punishment for failing to fulfil their duty in restraining a mutinous
                    soldier and his officer. This came after a six-week cycle in which pleas for leniency in Calcutta
                    were considered. On March 29, Sepoy Shaikh Paltu was promoted to havildar (sergeant) for his
                    actions, but he was assassinated in a remote area of the Barrackpore cantonment shortly before the
                    regiment was disbanded.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The 34th B.N.I. had a strong recent record, according to Indian historian Surendra Nath Sen, and the
                    Court of Enquiry had found no proof of a connection with unrest at Berhampore concerning the 19th
                    B.N.I. four weeks ago (see below). However, Mangal Pandey's conduct, as well as the reluctance of
                    the quarter-armed guards and on-duty sepoys to act, persuaded British military authorities that the
                    regiment as a whole was untrustworthy. Pandey appears to have acted without first gaining the
                    confidence of other sepoys, but the regiment's antipathy against its British officers had led most
                    of those present to behave as spectators rather than follow orders.

                <h1>
                    Motivation and Story of a New Form of Bullet Cartridge in Detail</h1>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Mangal Pandey's personal motive for his actions remains a mystery. "Come out – the Europeans are
                    here," he yelled to other sepoys during the incident, "from biting these cartridges we shall become
                    infidels," and "you sent me out here, why don't you join me." He argued at his court-martial that he
                    had been using bhang and opium and was unaware of his actions on March 29.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    A number of factors led to the Bengal Army's anxiety and distrust in the months leading up to the
                    Barrackpore incident. The reference to cartridges made by Pandey is generally attributed to a new
                    form of bullet cartridge used in the Enfield P-53 rifle, which was to be introduced in the Bengal
                    Army that year. The cartridge was thought to be greased with animal fat, mainly from cows and pigs,
                    which Hindus and Muslims, respectively, could not eat (the former a holy animal of the Hindus and
                    the latter being abhorrent to Muslims). Before use, the cartridges had to be bitten at one end. Some
                    Indian troops in some regiments believed it was a deliberate act by the British to defile their
                    religions.
                    <br>
                    Colonel S. Wheeler of the 34th B.N.I. was a devout Christian who preached with zeal. The Bible was printed in Urdu and Hindi and circulated among the sepoys by the wife of Captain William Halliday of the 56th B.N.I., creating doubts among them that the British were trying to convert them to Christianity.
                    <br>
                    The 19th B.N.I. is significant because, on February 26, 1857, it was the regiment tasked with testing the new cartridges. However, new rifles had not been given to them prior to the mutiny, and the cartridges in the regiment's magazine were as grease-free as they had been for the previous half-century. The cartridges were wrapped in a different colour paper, which raised suspicions. On February 26, the regiment's non-commissioned officers declined to consider the cartridges. Colonel William Mitchell, the commanding officer, was informed of this information and took it upon himself to persuade the sepoys that the cartridges were identical to those they were used to and that they did not need to bite it. He ended his speech by pleading with the native officers to preserve the regiment's honour and threatening to court-martial any sepoys who refused to accept the cartridge. The regiment's sepoys, on the other hand, confiscated their bell of arms the next morning (weapons store). Mitchell's subsequent accommodative behaviour persuaded the sepoys to return to their barracks.

                <h3>Court of Enquiry</h3>
                <p class="card-text">A Court of Enquiry was convened, and after a nearly month-long review, the 19th B.N.I. was recommended to be disbanded. On March 31, the same procedure was followed. The 19th B.N.I. were permitted to keep their uniforms and were given allowances by the government to return to their homes. Colonel Mitchell of the 19th B.N.I. and Colonel Wheeler of Pandey's 34th B.N.I. were both deemed unfit to command any new regiments raised to replace the disbanded units after the incident on March 29.</p>
                <h3>Death</h3>
                <p class="card-text">On the afternoon of March 29, 1857, Pandey was pacing agitatedly in front of the regiment's guard room. He appeared ecstatic and was shouting to his fellow sepoys. With a loaded musket, he threatened to shoot the first European he saw that day. “Come out, the Europeans are here,” he yelled to the other soldiers, and “by biting these cartridges, we shall become infidels.” Sergeant-Major James Hewson arrived on the scene after being informed of Pandey's actions. When he ordered Indian officer Jemadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Pandey, Prasad refused, arguing that he couldn't do it alone. Lieutenant Henry Baugh, the Sergeant-Major's adjutant, appeared on a horse and was shot at by Pandey – this is known as the first gunshot at an Englishman during the Revolt of 1857. Pandey missed the lieutenant and instead struck his horse. Pandey was battling Baugh after this when Hewson approached him. He was knocked unconscious. Throughout the ordeal, no soldiers stepped forward to assist the officers. Just one soldier, Shaikh Paltu, attempted to help the English. Other sepoys assaulted Paltu with stones and shoes for attempting to assist the Englishmen. When the other soldiers threatened to shoot him if he didn't let go of the mutinous sepoy, Paltu grabbed him. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="card-text">Meanwhile, General Hearsey, the commanding officer, arrived on the scene with two officers. Pandey attempted to kill himself with his musket after failing to invite all the men to open revolt. However, he just hurt himself and was arrested as a result. Mangal Pandey was put on trial and sentenced to death by hanging in less than a week. During his trial, he said that he mutinied of his own free will and that no other sepoy encouraged him. Since he had told the other soldiers not to arrest Pandey, Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was also sentenced to death by hanging. Pandey was executed on April 8, 1857, and Prasad on April 21, 1857, according to the verdict. The BNI's entire 34th Regiment was disbanded "with disgrace" on May 6th. This was done after an inquiry found that the soldiers had failed to restrain a mutinous soldier. Sepoy Paltu was promoted to Havildar before the regiment was disbanded, but he was murdered within the cantonment. One of the main preceding events before the 1857 revolution was Mangal Pandey's act of rebellion.</p>
